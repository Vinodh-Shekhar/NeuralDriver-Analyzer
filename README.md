# NeuralDriver Analyzer

AI-assisted GPU driver validation dashboard for detecting frame pacing instability, stutter events, and performance regressions between driver builds.

This prototype simulates a GPU QA validation tool similar to those used in graphics driver testing pipelines.

---

## Overview

NeuralDriver Analyzer analyzes frame time telemetry collected during gameplay benchmarks.

The tool detects:

- Frame pacing instability
- Micro stutters
- Performance regressions between driver builds
- Frame time anomalies using AI-based analysis

This enables faster validation of GPU drivers before release.

## Key Features

Driver Comparison Mode  
Upload telemetry from two driver builds and compare performance stability.

Frame Time Analysis  
Visualize frame pacing and detect irregular frame delivery.

AI-Assisted Anomaly Detection  
Identify frame spikes that indicate rendering instability.

Driver Regression Detection  
Automatically detect when a new driver introduces performance regressions.

Telemetry Dashboard  
Modern developer-style dashboard inspired by GPU monitoring tools.
